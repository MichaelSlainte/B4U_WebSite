#OVERVIEW 
This project proposes to develop a responsive website for a bicycles and accessories shop called B4U (Bike for you). 
Tool used for the development of the website were: Brackets Software | HTLM | CSS | Java Script | jQuery | Github 


#TEAM WORK 
We started the project trying to pick up an idea which was relevant for our skills development regarding a development of a web site.
Our choice was to develop a web site for bikes and bikes accessories. A website which can be shown as a display window for the shop. 
In the meantime, from the manager perspective to be “digitally” in contact with the clientele.  
Our project was based on: html, css and Jquery effects.  
After the concept settled and the main idea defined, we sketched it. The goal of this step was to get a website overview in paper format. 
While the sketch elaboration, we decided the main colours, the structure and the content organization. We worked together on the logo 
design, the slogan and writing the content. 
After it we worked on the code together and decided the main parts of the website. Then we divided the different team work as following:

#ALEKSANDRO CANDIDO
On the header (html code), worked on the font link. 
On the main page, responsible by gathering the pictures. 
Set up buttons and linking them with the different parts connected together. 
He handled the store locator section (Google Maps map + 2 icons - Java Script use to call the map) and the testimonies section 
across html and css.

#MICHAL MARQUES
Dealt with the section “Before you, life was meaningless” with the 4 icons and 4 text columns (css and html).
Worked on the form “we’re happy to hear from you” with html, css, and J-query.
Responsible by the website validation (part 2 –“validation” of the guidelines).


#NUNO
In charge of the grid link and the icon’s links on the header of html file.
In the first body section main page, he worked on the dark effect of the picture (gradient pic CSS).
Also he set up the 4 pictures (before “store locator” section) in order to get the effect expected (zoom in and zoom out plus color 
balance) while hoving them.  
Social media icons in the footer


#EXTERNAL RESOURCES
To develop our website, we used tool and resources available on internet as:
- Fonts: We used the fonts found under “Google fonts” (www.google.com/fonts).
- Colour:  To define the colour of our website we used the resource available on “Adobe Color CC, play around with colors” 
(color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/). Where we could define the best color match and gradients for our website.
- Icons: To choose the icons found on our website we used as resource the website called “ionicons” (http://ionicons.com/).

website. 
- JQUERY PLUGINS: We used resource from:   http://www.webappers.com/category/components/tool.ps/    

 

#CONCLUSION 
We worked by alternating teamwork and personal tasks. We used Google Drive for sharing code and images. The teamwork was pleasant 
thanks to a strong commitment of each of us and a good communication and understanding. We shared our code parts and ideas to learn 
even more from each other, and to optimize the result. The different points of views of each, and different background and experience 
were a strength for the project and for the teamwork experience.
